# compact 2 port usb-c hub for bigscreen beyond
This is a very compact usb hub with two female usb-c ports i designed, mostly to use on the auxiliary port of the bigscreen beyond. This is supposed to be a usb 2.0 port, it includes the CC lines termination resistors on both output ports.

The board is based around a CH334P. I'm including the schematic, PCB and BOM. you can get all the components on LCSC or other providers. 

The input usb-c port is a cut USB-C 2.0 cable with a Molex male header:

The male header is a Molex 501330-0400 with Molex 92001-1198 cable assembly

The female socket is Molex 501568-0407
